The challenge is almost done, It took me 2.5 days to create this application. I have implemented CRUD operations over Landing Pages with a pleasing UI/UX experience.

Things Left:
1) Authentication Mechanism
2) Code Cleanup
3) Analytics like Views Counting

If this was a production-grade application, I would implement the following:
1) More accurate form handling
2) Making Custom Errors and using try/catch everywhere possible
3) Making the pages across the app protected
4) adding loading animations before the data is fetched
5) better implementation of server/client components
6) adding loading state to buttons
7) adding migration client like drizzle-orm or prisma

Few Descisons I made regarding the tech stack used:
1) Used next.js for server-side HTML generation and better seo.
2) Used supabase for storing and retrieving data
3) Used typescript for type validation and better developer experience
4) extended airbnb-eslint for better-enforcing rules of code quality
5) used tailwind css for faster markup creation



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
